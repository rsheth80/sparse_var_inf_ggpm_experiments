This is the code used to create figures for [1]. Run the startup file to add 
paths in the correct order. The function 'random_sample' in the main directory 
has changed in the latest version of 'sparse_var_inf_ggpm' so the original 
'random_sample.m' file is included here for reproducibility. 

This testing code was validated by re-creating the top left plots of Figs. 2 
and 3 and the left plots of Fig. 4 in [1]. Only the first 5 inducing set sizes
for the ucsdpeds1l count data set were used for the validation. This output data
is included in a zip file.

The zip file holding the data needs to be unzipped to a sibling directory of the
directory that this code resides in (or paths need to be appropriately modified
in the sod_exp_gp*.m and sparse_exp_gp*.m files).
