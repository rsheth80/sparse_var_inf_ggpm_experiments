This is the code used to create figures for [1]. It was validated by re-creating
the top left plots of Figs. 2 and 3 and the left plots of Fig. 4 in [1]. Only 
the first 5 inducing set sizes for the ucsdpeds1l count data set were used for 
the validation. This output data is included in a zip file.

*** 1. Required Packages ***

    GPML toolbox    http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/
    minFunc         http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/minFunc.html

Tested with GPML toolbox v3.4 and minFunc_2012 on Matlab 2012a/b.

*** 2. Setup ***

Run the startup file to add paths in the correct order. The function 
'random_sample' in the main directory has changed in the latest version of 
'sparse_var_inf_ggpm' so the original 'random_sample.m' file is included here 
for reproducibility. Also, the original version of likCumLog.m is included for 
the same reason.

The zip file holding the data needs to be unzipped to a sibling directory of the
directory that this code resides in (or paths need to be appropriately modified
in the sod_exp_gp*.m and sparse_exp_gp*.m files).
